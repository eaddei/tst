        It's never too late to be a pro musician. This program allows pupils to
        perform onstage at their church or other locations. Start now!

          <h3>Core Classes</h3>
          <p>
            We include classes in directing, ear training, harmonization,
            melodic harmony and rhythm, and sound engineering. These courses
            form the cornerstone of Emmanuel's musical education programs, and
            the inducted student competency evaluation and exposure to music
            innovation test are meant to examine each incoming student's depth
            of knowledge in either of these core curriculum disciplines. The
            competency examination and the Prelude to Music Performance test
            scores allow Emmanuel's Music to enroll each student in the proper
            conveyance, ear training, harmonization, and music science courses.
            Students go on to advanced studies in conducting and tonal harmony
            and counterpoint after successfully completing courses in these
            primary areas.

          <h3>Beginner Friendly For Kids and Adults</h3>
          <p>
            With private training and frequent group band rehearsals, our
            skilled music instructors will lead your kid from concept to
            execution. When giving music lessons to children, every faculty
            member at Emmanuel Music School is a highly qualified musician who
            focuses on fundamental music theory and technique. It's never too
            late to start learning to play an instrument. Our accomplished
            teachers educate adult students through famous gospel tunes, and
            they learn to play the instruments in a demanding and enjoyable
            manner. This program allows pupils to perform onstage at their
            church or other locations.

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Intermediate To Advace</h3>
          <p>
            We advance students to more difficult programs at higher ability
            levels as they develop skills and expertise. Intermediate and
            advanced students build on the abilities they gained in basic music
            classes by incorporating more complex techniques and concepts.
            Emmanuel Music School provides advanced music education for children
            and adults, teaching via the performance of demanding Ghanaian music
            styles (highlife, local worship, praises, etc.) and contemporary
            songs, emphasizing the use of instruments in a live music setting.
            Our Ghanaian instructors will collaborate with each student to
            create a personalized learning plan.
