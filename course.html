          <h3>Song Writing</h3>
          <p>
            For musicians, writing unique music may be among the most
            pleasurable and fulfilling activities. The songwriting program at
            Emmanuel Music School assists students in creating creative
            compositions while teaching the principles of songwriting,
            arrangement, and music theory. Students receive one regular private
            session on their chosen instrument, where they study theory,
            technique, and ideas. These ideas are then put into practice in
            weekly group courses where students collaborate on lyrical workshops
            and songwriting activities. Every few months, participants in the
            Songwriting Program play live or form bands to record their own
            music.

          <h3>Performance</h3>
          <p>
            Numerous students participate each year in the Performance Program,
            which is EMS's signature music course. The Performance Program,
            which employs the proprietary EMS Method, consists of a weekly group
            practice where young people learn by performing the most well-known
            songs from jazz, highlife, gospel, and other genres with a band made
            up of their colleagues. Taking into account their knowledge and
            capacity to acquire new techniques and ideas, teachers give students
            songs and parts that are suitable for them. The abilities and ideas
            introduced by those songs are then further developed by students
            during weekly private music sessions. This program aims to get
            youngsters and teenagers ready for live performances. Students from
            the Performance Program play in the presence of live audiences at
            local venues periodically.

          <h3>SINGING LESSONS</h3>
          <p>
            Millennial singers and aspiring vocalists go to EMS to acquire the
            basics of singing, such as breathing, posture, and diction. Across
            pitch training, timbre development, and maintaining a steady pace,
            our experienced voice instructors aid beginning singers as they
            proceed through the early phases of vocal development. Intermediate
            to advanced vocal training from EMS provides expert voice
            instruction and singing classes to help practicing students achieve
            their full potential. To expand a student's vocal repertoire, our
            talented vocal coaches concentrate on sophisticated singing methods.
            Each program at EMS combines private singing lessons with full-band
            group rehearsals and live concerts in order to help students reach a
            greater level of vocal proficiency.

          <h3>GUITAR LESSONS</h3>
          <p>
            During regular private guitar lessons and group rehearsals, our
            introductory guitar courses spark creativity and encourage young
            students to develop into world-class guitarists. The underlying
            premise of EMS is that performance-based music education is the best
            approach for students to develop musical skills. Everyone of our
            guitar classes for students contains a performance component. Our
            intermediate and advanced guitar classes are designed to expand on
            the concepts that students learned in their introductory sessions
            and programs. Private guitar lessons are combined with full-band
            group sessions and stage performances in these curricula, enabling
            student guitarists to demonstrate their abilities by performing
            advanced tunes by famous artists. Our world-class guitar
            instructors' unique teaching method has been shown to improve
            students' ability to play and achieve at higher levels.

          <h3>BRASS & PERCUSSION</h3>
          <p>
            Take part at Emmanuel Music School, or EMS for short, and see your
            kid or yourself develop into a brass or percussion musician.
            Thousands of students have learned to play music using our
            proprietary EMS approach, both in Ghana and other countries. Our
            method incorporates spectacular theatrical performance to develop
            musical skill. By teaching the songs that move them, EMS helps kids
            begin a lifetime of musical exploration. Our Song First method,
            which is a component of the EMS Method, teaches theory and technique
            through well-known songs. Students who use this approach are more
            likely to be enthusiastic about learning music and enthusiastic
            about practicing.
