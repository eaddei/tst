          <!-- <h1>ABOUT ME</h1> -->
          <h2>Professor Emmanuel Antwi- Music Background</h2>
          <p>
            Emmanuel Oppong Antwi brings approximately 28 years of 
            professional musical experience here as a music instructor, 
            performer, recording vocalist, originator, and songwirter. 
            Emmanuel began his career as a teacher by establishing a music 
            department in Abuakwa, Maakro, in Kumasi, Ghana, where he taught 
            music and directed all the church bands and choir. He subsequently 
            went on to work as a music teacher in many Abuakwa school 
            districts, where he taught instrumental music, band, orchestra, 
            and music education and employment. Emmanuel currently focuses his 
            teaching activities as a private lesson instrumental instructor, 
            providing music classes such as private piano lessons, bass guitar 
            lessons, lead guitar lessons, drum lessons, voice training, and 
            several others at his private school of music in Abuakwa, Maakro, 
            in Kumasi, Ghana. Emmanuel is also involved in the realm of music 
            technology. He creates his own records in his multi-track home 
            recording studio, encompassing a wide spectrum of music, from 
            contemporary music to jazz. These quantum dots include his songs 
            and arrangements, as well as Emmanuel's abilities as a 
            multi-instrumentalist, who plays the piano, string instruments, 
            brass, and drums.
